ðŸ‘‹ Thunderboom Records is the world's first record label for robots.  specialise in responsible AI-driven music tools and virtual artists.
At Thunderboom Records, we believe that AI-powered music tools and virtual artists are an inevitable future because the developments in the field of AI and 3D media are more than promising.
It is our goal to make sure that AI will always be an enrichment to human creative expression, instead of a threat. 
To reach this goal, we bring together multi-disciplinary project teams with musicians, technologists and designers to develop and produce responsible AI-powered music tools, artists, and live shows.
In 2020, Thunderboom Records was registered as a non-profit foundation to ensure that future creative AI technology will always be open and accessible to us all.
