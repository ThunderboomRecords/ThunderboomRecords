ðŸ‘‹ Thunderboom Records is an independent innovation lab at the cutting edge of music and new technology such as AI and mixed reality.

Our goal is to ensure that new technology is always enriching our human creative expression, rather than harming it.

To reach our goal, we initiate and produce technology-driven music projects together with a great diversity of artists, audiences, designers, programmers and music industry professionals.

Our projects take many forms: from open-source AI tools to keynote series and from virtual artists to accessible hardware.
